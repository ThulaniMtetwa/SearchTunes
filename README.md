# Search Tunes

Using the apples https://itunes.apple.com/search API. The application allows for you to 
search for music or songs, and presents to you the results of the song and the artist.

# Architecture used
- Structurally I followed the MVVM pattern

# Any design pattern used
- Singleton Pattern
- Delegate Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Observer Pattern

# Which OOP principle applied
- Classes
- Objects
- Properties
- Methods
- Access Control
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Method Overriding

# Any important decision taken and its motivation
- Structurally the MVVM pattern helps allow for better test and separation of concerns
- Using delegate/interfaces to help with dependency injection and unit testing this is demonstrated on the units tests where mocking is required for my HTTPClient implementation

# Implement the bonus features according to the senior level you would like to be
considered for

- I used my knowledge of iOS native frameworks to levarage feature on them instead of relying on 3rd party frameworks. (e.g. iOS Network.framework)

# Note from me:
- More unit tests can be added to increase the current code coverage. Given more time this can be done.
- Allow for the Network layer to be generic and an not work with concrete types but rather introducing interface driven code.
